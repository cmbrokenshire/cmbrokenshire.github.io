            <h3>1.1 Abstract</h3>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach to categorizing
                news articles using a combination of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
                classification and Sentence Transformers. The primary aim of
                this study is to develop a method that efficiently organizes
                large volumes of news articles based on their titles, thereby
                enhancing the accessibility of information and improving user
                experience. We leverage the SentenceTransformers framework
                for vectorizing article titles into numerical embeddings, which are
                then classified using a custom KNN algorithm designed for tensor
                data. This approach capitalizes on the principle that articles
                with similar titles often share the same category. Our results
                demonstrate a significant accuracy score, indicating the efficacy
                of our method in categorizing news articles. The simplicity of
                our model, compared to more complex NLP systems, offers a
                computationally efficient alternative while maintaining a high
                level of accuracy. The paper also discusses the limitations of
                our approach, particularly in domain invariance, and suggests
                potential areas for future improvement. This study contributes
                to the field of natural language processing by demonstrating
                the application of traditional machine learning techniques in
                addressing modern-day challenges in information categorization</p>
