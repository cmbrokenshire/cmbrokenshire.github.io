        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my page! I'm Christopher Brokenshire, a student majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the College of William and Mary. Here, I share insights and experiences from my journey in computer science, particularly in the realm of Machine Learning.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Projects:</strong> This area showcases various projects from my ML courses. It includes a range of projects from class assignments to significant contributions made during internships. The section is a compilation of practical applications and my learnings in the field.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Domain Generalization Research:</strong> This section covers my involvement in research under Professor Gaoâ€™s guidance. It encompasses work from my honor's thesis and other collaborative projects in the lab, offering a glimpse into the research process and its challenges in domain generalization.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> Beyond academic pursuits, I also engage in personal projects where I explore complex problems using machine learning. This section is an exploration of different approaches and methodologies applied to real-world scenarios, reflecting my continuous learning process in this field.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Datasets:</strong> The datasets that I've compiled and utilized for various machine learning challenges are presented here. These datasets are crucial in supporting the algorithms and approaches used in my projects, highlighting the importance of quality data in research.</p>
         
        <p><strong>About:</strong> Here I provide all important scholastic information about my time in university so far. This includes resume, unofficial transcript and letters of recomendation.

        <p>This page serves as a repository of my experiences and learnings in AI, showcasing both the academic and practical aspects of my journey in this dynamic field.</p>
